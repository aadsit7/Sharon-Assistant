// mode.js — Sharon's one mode manager. She is in exactly ONE mode at a time:
//
//   LISTENING  (default) — normal conversation: adaptive listening, barge-in,
//                          memory tools, agent tasks. Every mode ends here.
//   RECORDING  — the recorder owns the ears; command listening, TTS, assist
//                and page context are all off until the whole flow (record →
//                upload → organize) is done.
//   SCREEN_REC — the screen recorder owns the capture: getDisplayMedia video +
//                merged audio records up to 30 minutes, then downloads straight
//                to the user's computer (never the backend). Spoken input is
//                dropped until it ends, exactly like RECORDING.
//   SCREEN     — one look at the current tab; the next message is answered
//                with that snapshot attached, then the mode ends itself.
//   SEARCHING  — automatic: lit while an assist call is out running a web
//                search, cleared when the reply arrives (or is interrupted).
//
// Exclusivity is enforced HERE, not by each feature: entering a mode always
// runs the previous mode's exit routine first, so no code path can leave
// Sharon in two modes at once. If an exit or enter routine throws, the
// manager lands in LISTENING with a clean status instead of a stuck mode.
//
// This module is logic-free about the modes themselves — the orchestrator
// (sidepanel.js) registers each mode's enter/exit routine and reads the
// current mode; features check the manager instead of scattered flags.
